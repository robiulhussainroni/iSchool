<!-- Planning the project -->

### Header

Easy! I'll just use logo and navigation to the sections. Adding a CTA in the navigation will also be a good idea !

### Hero Section

A good title that grab attention of users and a 2-3 lines of short description ! obviously, a CTA to grab attention of the user again. As per for content, I'm not a content writer, ChatGPT is here for me! 1 Image that can describe the school! For Image, Pexels and Unsplash is here for me !

### Featured In Section

I believe this is the best place for something like this. A hero section that grab attentions and Immediately when user scroll down they'll see it and it'll be very good for credibility. Few NewsPaper logo would be enough!

<!-- Okay first Give them life and then can start thinking about other sections -->

### Why Choose Us ?

I'm not sure how to design this section. But I think it could be serve as features section. Let me think...

Well, how about showing the specialitis of the school with image and the layout in Z pattern.

<!-- Design Decisions -->

**Color** : I'm choosing Teal as primary color. Teal represents creativity, stability and it's commonly used in education inductry. Open Color is here for me to find a great version of Teal. I also try to use Tints and Shades of Teal. As per for Secondary color, I haven't selected yet!

**Font** : I'm choosing Serif font. It's represents reliability, proffessionalism, formality. First, I want to go with 'Times New Roman' and let's see what happens !
